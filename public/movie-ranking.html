<h1>Top Supernatural Movies/Series according to Krishna.</h1>
<h2>My favourite movies/series of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1- Vampire Diaries.</h3>
<p>
  I m a big fan of this series because Damon's sarcastic manner of speaking and
  his attitude are simply incredible! It's just so amazing.
</p>
<h3>2- Teen WOlf.</h3>
<p>
  I absolutely love this series because it revolves around the supernatural,
  specifically werewolves. It's such an amazing show, and the fact that it's
  available on Netflix makes it even better!.
</p>
<h3>3- Arrow.</h3>
<p>
  Last but not least, this series is truly outstanding. It falls under the
  category of fictional movies, but it's absolutely awesome. Personally, one
  aspect that captivates me is the attitude of Oliver Queen. It's utterly
  fascinating. You can find this amazing series on Prime Video.
